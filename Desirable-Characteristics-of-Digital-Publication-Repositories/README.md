This document states:

> A set of desirable characteristics alongside good practices is necessary to
> - increase interoperability across the national and global repository network and
> - establish suitability of a digital publication repository to be an "agency-designated" repository for federally funded research.


It goes on to explain that the concept of an "agency-designated" repository is to be understood in the context of the *[OSTP memorandum on Ensuring Free, Immediate, and Equitable Access to Federally Funded Research, August 2022](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/08-2022-OSTP-Public-Access-Memo.pdf)*.

The USRN Discovery Project is using the *Desirable Characteristics of Digital Publication Repositories* as a convenient framework to shape its activities.
